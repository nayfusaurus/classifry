Subject: Re: Q4 Project Timeline Update

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for sending over the updated project timeline. I've reviewed the milestones
and everything looks good for our Q4 deliverables.

A few notes:
- The October 15th deadline for the design review works well with our team's schedule
- I've confirmed that the engineering resources will be available starting November 1st
- Let's plan to sync up next Tuesday at 2pm to discuss the budget allocation

I've attached the revised resource plan that incorporates your feedback from last
week's meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs
to be adjusted.

Also, don't forget we have the team lunch scheduled for Friday at noon at the usual
place. Looking forward to seeing everyone there.

Best regards,
